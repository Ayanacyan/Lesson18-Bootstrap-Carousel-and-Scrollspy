        <h3>Plotting the Stars: Moongarden by Michelle A. Barry</h3>
        <h5>Centuries ago, Earth’s plants turned deadly, and humanity took to space to cultivate new homes.
         Myra Hodger is in her first year at an elite school on the Moon, and she’s crumbling under the pressure.
         She doesn’t fit in and, worse, the tattoos that signal her Number Whisperer magic aren’t developing. 
         In her heart, she knows she doesn’t have a Creer, and soon everyone else will, too.</h5>

<p>Wandering the halls while cutting class, she discovers a secret lab hidden behind one of the unused classrooms and, beyond that, a secret garden overflowing with plants.
Dangerous toxic plants.

As she learns more about the garden, Myra begins to wonder if she does have a Creer after all—one that died out when the Earth did.
 One that could help solve the food shortages the government doesn’t want anyone to know about.</p>
